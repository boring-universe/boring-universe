# The Boring Universe

The Boring Universe is an open literary universe. Anyone may contribute, as
long as their contribution meets the following criteria:

1. It must take place at a specific date in the future
2. It must be feasible

Contributions don't need to be well-written. They don't need to be interesting,
original, complete or grammatically correct.

They can take any form you choose: short story, poem, haiku, novela, graphic
novel, screenplay, concept image.

If you make a contribution, you are in control of all editorial decisions for
that work. Others may offer suggestions or improvements, but it is entirely up
to you whether to accept them.

However, if someone is able to convince one of our editors that any aspect of
your work is not feasible, they will have then have the freedom to replace that
aspect with a more feasible alternative. You may then update your work for
style, tone, etc, so long as your updates remain feasible.
